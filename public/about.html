<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I graduated from the University of Iowa in May 2024 with a BA in computer science. In my time at the University of Iowa,
  I learned Python, Java, and C. Since then I have also mastered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
</p>

<p>I have worked 3 jobs in my life. My father owns a construction company and that has been my summer job since 2016.
  This job has taught me the value of hard work. 
  I then worked at Menards as a morning shelf-stocker. This job taught me how to work with customers
  I then worked for the University of Iowa as a part of IT department. My job title was Physcial Infastructure.
  I worked with installing cables to keep their network up and running while also troubleshooting issues that arose.
  This job allowed me to see how networks work and taught me how to problem sovle and work with a team.
</p>

<p>I enjoy coding. Outside of school I have completed many courses such as 100 days to Python Mastery, The complete guide to Java, and The Complete Wed Development Bootcamp
  I used these courses to not only learn the languages, but to also further my understanding. These courses were a great way to push myself in my knowledge.
